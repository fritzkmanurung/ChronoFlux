## üí° The Story Behind the Name: ChronoFlux

The name **ChronoFlux** was carefully chosen to reflect both the function and the aesthetic of this project. It's a combination of two words:

-   **Chrono**: Derived from the Greek word *'khronos'*, meaning **time**.
-   **Flux**: Derived from the Latin word *'fluxus'*, meaning **to flow** or a state of continuous change.

Together, **ChronoFlux** poetically translates to **"The Flow of Time"**. This name perfectly captures the application's essence: its core purpose is to track the relentless passage of time, while its visual design‚Äîwith flowing particles and shifting gradients‚Äîmirrors the constant and fluid nature of time itself.

## üåü Key Features

-   **Complete Time & Date Display**: Shows real-time hours, minutes, seconds, along with the day, date, month, and year.

-   **Immersive Fullscreen Mode**: Switch to fullscreen for a distraction-free experience.
-   **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Access key features like the Stopwatch (`S`), Alarm (`A`), and Fullscreen (`F11`) with ease.
-   **Glassmorphism & Fluid Animations**: A stunning modern UI with a transparent blur effect, dynamic shadows, and smooth animations.
-   **Dynamic Particle Background**: Floating particles create a lively and futuristic background.
-   **Glowing Text & Borders**: Eye-catching glow effects and shifting color gradients on text and UI elements.
-   **Responsive Design**: Looks and works great on all devices, from large desktops to small mobile screens.
